# Monitoring Spark DC/OS Service

To start collecting metrics and visualize them, you should initially install the [mesosphere/prometheus](https://github.com/mesosphere/prometheus)
service. This service installs Grafana, Prometheus and the Mesos exporter.

To push/fetch metrics to Prometheus, you need to previously install the `dcos-metrics`
Prometheus plugin on each agent for `DC/OS` version older than `1.11`. For `DC/OS`
version greater or equal than `v.1.11`, this plugin is already integrated into
`dcos-metrics`.

In this repository, we added few [dashboards](./dashboards) that will show some graphs for you:
- DC/OS: This dashboard only works in DC/OS v1.11.X where the dcos-metrics also exposes
task metrics.
- Mesos: This dashboard plots some metrics related to Mesos.
- Spark: This dashboard shows a bunch of graphs with related Spark metrics.

To load this dashboards in Grafana, you need at least one public agent on your
cluster to access to the Grafana UI. Grafana is exposed in the url: `http://<public_agent_ip>:<grafana_port>`.
